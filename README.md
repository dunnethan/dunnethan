- Hi, Iâ€™m @dunnethan
- Iâ€™m interested in web development, machine learning applications, and mobile applications. Strong passion for combining good code and good visual design
- Iâ€™m currently learning vanilla JS, REACT, full stack web development
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that need assistance with visual design, but would also like to contribute more, just don't have the knowledge yet.
- I a have moderately strong background in responsive web design (BFA in Graphic Design, spent most of it working the front end of small websites), and am happy to contribute my general CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript knowledge to any project.
- Would love to learn a little more about server side interacctions, database management, etc.
